Dear Colleague

NIST, in coordination with the University of Maryland, is seeking to fill a post-doctoral position with an outstanding candidate.  This research position will extend and enhance the tools that NIST is developing to establish the infrastructure needed to achieve the goals set out in the Adminsitration's Materials Genome Initiative.  Specifically,  the qualified candidate should have a demonstrated record in the development of models and research codes linking processing to microstucture (such as phase field, level set, or related methods), and interest in learning and applying the data science tools and techniques that can elicit properties from the structural output of such codes.  This effort  will entail the identification and development of concepts in microstructure informatics and machine learning  and  then integrating these approaches into (i) the scikit-learn framework,  (ii) the NIST data/model repository infrastructure, and (iii) the NIST developed FiPy software.  

For more information please contact JAW, etc.
